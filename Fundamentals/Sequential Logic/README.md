# Basic Digital Logic Circuits (Logisim Designs)

This repository contains basic digital logic circuits built and simulated using **Logisim**.
Each design demonstrates a fundamental digital concept such as latches, flip-flops, and counters.
Truth tables and brief theoretical explanations are included for reference.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- All designs simulated in **Logisim Evolution**  
- You can modify clock frequency, propagation delays, or gate styles for visualization  
- Great for learning counters, registers, and sequential logic
